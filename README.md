# python_interview_preparation
One great thing about interviews is that you get to know what you don't know, luckily I had a lot of interviews (and I know how it feel when you want a job but they ask you a question, you don't know the answer, and I you end up feeling like that is something you should of know)

### Theorical Question 10

Do you know what would happen if you don't close a python file?

![Image](img/notClosingFile.png "notClosingFile")

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Calling the file close method terminates your connection to the external file, re-
leases its system resources, and flushes its buffered output to disk if any is still in
memory. As discussed in Chapter 6, in Python an objectâ€™s memory space is auto-
matically reclaimed as soon as the object is no longer referenced anywhere in the
program.

### Theorical Question 12

Do you understand the difference between generators and functions?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

return sends a result object back to the caller. When a function is called, the
caller stops until the function finishes its work and returns control to the caller.
Functions that compute a value send it back to the caller with a return statement;
the returned value becomes the result of the function call. A return without a value
simply returns to the caller (and sends back None , the default result).

yield sends a result object back to the caller, but remembers where it left
off. Special word "yield" create a generator. Functions known as generators may also use the yield statement to send back
